<h1>Abstract</h1>

<p>This SRFI defines syntax to create
  <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-121/">SRFI
    121</a>/<a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-158/">158</a>
  coroutine generators conveniently and in the flavor of Python
  generator functions.
</p>

<h1>Rationale</h1>

<p>In some sense, the most fundamental generator is the coroutine
  generator.  SRFI 121/158 allow the easy creation of a coroutine
  generator by calling the
  procedure <code>make-coroutine-generator</code>.
</p>

<p>For example, the following evaluates to a generator that produces
  the series 0, 1, and 2:</p>

<pre>
(make-coroutine-generator
  (lambda (yield)
    (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
        ((&lt;= 3 i))
      (yield i)))))
</pre>

<p>These generators are similar to the generator functions of Python.
  When using <code>make-coroutine-generator</code>, though, the
  programmer has to wrap the actual coroutine body in a lambda and
  has to explicitly bind the name of the yielding procedure.</p>

<p>In this SRFI, a syntax that evaluates to coroutine generators is
  defined that simplifies the creation of coroutine generators and
  avoids the need of binding the yielding procedure to a name.</p>

<p>Using the syntax of this SRFI, the above example becomes:</p>

<pre>
(coroutine-generator
  (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
      ((&lt;= 3 i))
    (yield i)))
</pre>

<p>The yielding procedure can be passed to helper procedures.</p>

<pre>
(let ((yield-square (lambda (yield i) (yield (* i i)))))
  (coroutine-generator
    (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
        ((&lt;= 3 i))
      (yield-square yield i))))
</pre>

<p>An equivalent version using a local macro would be:</p>

<pre>
(let-syntax ((yield-square (syntax-rules () ((_ i) (yield (* i i))))))
  (coroutine-generator
    (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
        ((&lt;= 3 i))
      (yield-square i))))
</pre>

<p>A Python generator function is not completely equivalent to a
  coroutine generator in the sense of SRFI 121/158 and this SRFI as a
  Python generator function has to be called first to return a
  generator.  This SRFI includes convenience syntax to define a
  generator function in the sense of Python.
</p>

<p>The following defines a procedure that returns a generator
  producing the series 0, 1, …, n − 1.</p>

<pre>
(define-coroutine-generator (g n)
  (do ((i 0 (+ i 1)))
      ((&lt;= n i))
    (yield i)))
</pre>

<p>All syntax defined in this SRFI is hygienic.  In particular, the
  identifier <code>yield</code> is exported (and bound to syntax) by
  any library implementing this SRFI.</p>

<p> While the sample implementation uses syntax parameters and
  identifier macros, a specific implementation that is being shipped
  by a particular Scheme system doesn't have to.  In fact, this is a
  reasonable thing for those systems for which
  <code>make-coroutine-generator</code> from SRFI 121/158 is slow
  because <code>call/cc</code> is slow in these systems (unfortunately,
  such systems exist). As <code>coroutine-generator</code> SRFI 190 is
  just syntax and offers no more than Python's generator functions (note
  that Python doesn't have <code>call/cc</code>), those systems can
  translate it directly into fast code that does not have to rely on
  first-class continuations. For this translation to be easy (and no
  more difficult than that what CPython has to do), it is crucial that
  <code>yield</code> is lexically scoped (and thus confined to the
  expanded body of the coroutine) and not dynamically bound.
</p>

<h1>Specification</h1>

<h2>Syntax</h2>

<p><code>(coroutine-generator 〈body〉)</code></p>

<p>Creates a generator from a coroutine.  When evaluated, immediately
returns a generator <var>g</var>.  When <var>g</var> is called, the
  definitions and expressions in <code>〈body〉</code> are evaluated
  until the yielding procedure of the coroutine generator is called.
  Calling the yielding procedure of the coroutine generator causes the
  evaluation of <code>〈body〉</code> to be suspended,
  and <var>g</var> returns the value passed to yield.</p>

<p>Whether this generator is finite or infinite depends on the
  behavior of <code>〈body〉</code>. If the last expression
  in <code>〈body〉</code> returns, it is the end of the sequence —
<var>g</var>
  returns an end-of-file object from then on.</p>

<p><code>yield</code></p>

<p>Evaluates to the yielding procedure in the (expansion of the)
  <code>〈body〉</code> of a coroutine generator.</p>

<p>It is an error to evaluate <code>yield</code> outside the body of
a coroutine generator.</p>

<p><code>(define-coroutine-generator 〈name〉 〈body〉)</code></p>
<p><code>(define-coroutine-generator (〈name〉 . 〈formals〉) 〈body〉)</code></p>

<p>Expands into</p>

  <pre>  (define 〈name〉 (coroutine-generator 〈body〉))</pre>

and

  <pre>  (define (〈name〉 . 〈formals〉) (coroutine-generator 〈body〉))</pre>

<p>respectively.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>The following implementation based on SRFI 121/158 makes use of
  syntax parameters as defined in SRFI 139 and identifier syntax as
  defined in the R6RS.</p>

<pre>
(define-syntax-parameter yield
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      (_ (error "yield used outside coroutine generator" stx)))))

(define-syntax coroutine-generator
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      ((_ . body)
       #'(make-coroutine-generator
          (lambda (%yield)
            (syntax-parameterize ((yield (identifier-syntax %yield)))
              . body)))))))

(define-syntax define-coroutine-generator
  (lambda (stx)
    (syntax-case stx ()
      ((_ name . body) #'(define name (coroutine-generator . body))))))
</pre>

<p>Any implementation will define the identifiers <code>yield</code>,
  <code>define-coroutine-generator</code>,
  and <code>coroutine-generator</code> in the library <code>(srfi
    190)</code>.
